## Module Data

### Get Options for modules. 

A basic query to get the module options from the database. Need to break it up because I don't like the data format.

SELECT wd.widgetid, w.template, w.icon, wd.name, p.text FROM widgetdefinition AS wd
  JOIN widget AS w ON (w.widgetid = wd.widgetid)
  JOIN phrase AS p ON (wd.labelphrase = p.varname)
  WHERE w.template !='';
